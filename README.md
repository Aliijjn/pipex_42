# pipex_42
Pipex is a project in the 42 curriculum, about forks and pipes.
The goal of the project is to write a programme, that takes in the following: `INFILE, COMMAND1, COMMAND2, OUTFILE`
The programme will read the infile and use that as input for the first command,
which will send its output to the second command, which will write its output to the outfile.
There's one twist to this however, the commands are both forks of the main programme, and can only communicate via pipes.

This project will teach you how to to use forks and pipes, and how to cleanly handle any errors they might throw.
It'll also teach you the basics of multithreading, which will be useful for later projects.
